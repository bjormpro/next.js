// This suite tests the static App Shell prefetch attempt.
//
// When a route's tree prefetch response carries the static-prefetch hint —
// set iff the render that produced the tree accessed NO runtime data
// (cookies, headers, searchParams, fallback params) — the client's Shell
// prefetch phase attempts STATIC per-segment prefetches of the App Shell
// instead of the runtime shell request it would otherwise issue. Each static
// response signals whether a runtime request would return more than it did,
// and when the responses arrive the scheduler checks that signal for each
// shell segment:
//
// - If every shell segment is sufficient, the Shell phase completes with no
//   runtime request. A segment can be sufficient even when it's partial, as
//   long as its holes are *dynamic* (only fillable by the navigation-time
//   dynamic request, e.g. `connection()`), not *runtime* (fillable by a
//   runtime prefetch, e.g. cookies).
// - If any shell segment is insufficient, the existing single batched
//   runtime shell prefetch fires as a fallback. The attempt is serial,
//   never raced: static attempt → observe → runtime only if needed.
//
// If the hint is unset, the client goes straight to the runtime shell
// request (previous behavior).
//
// All of the above concerns the NEW part of the target tree — the segments
// that differ from the current page. Segments shared with the current page
// are outside the shell-attempt machinery entirely: the shared part of the
// tree always performs the ordinary static per-segment prefetch, in every
// phase, regardless of the hint — mirroring how runtime requests also cover
// only the new part. In this suite the shared part is always just the root
// layout (every link is prefetched from the home page), and its cache entry
// is already populated from the initial page load's seed data, so the shared
// walk is a cache hit and no request fires for it. What the tests can pin is
// the other half of the model: runtime requests never cover the shared part
// (see the layout rejection in the cookies test).
//
// The hint reflects the WHOLE render that produced the tree: any runtime-
// data access unsets it, no matter how late in the render the access
// happened. The per-segment signal is finer-grained: the shell variant of a
// segment response covers only what rendered during the shell stage, so an
// access recorded after that stage leaves the shell variant clean ("no
// runtime request needed for the shell") even though the full response
// records it. A stale cached tree can also disagree with fresh segment
// responses — the divergent fixtures below exploit this deliberately.
//
// This suite asserts directly on App Shell prefetch responses, so every
// `createRouterAct` call passes `{ includeAppShellRequests: true }` — by
// default router-act excludes runtime shell requests from assertions.
// Expectations additionally use `kind: 'static' | 'runtime'` to assert HOW a
// piece of content arrived: 'static' matches per-segment static prefetch
// requests (including the route tree prefetch), 'runtime' matches dynamic
// prefetch requests (e.g. the runtime shell request).
